# RoImGui
A powerful, versatile and ridiculously easy-to-use immediate mode UI library for debugging and logging Roblox projects. Based heavily off [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/), an open source immediate mode library for C++.

## Getting Started
To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "RoImGui.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `RoImGui.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
